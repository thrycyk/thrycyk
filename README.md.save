## 📖 Overview
This repository documents my learning journey in SQL and Python for data science, including study notes from the Coursera/IBM course and a hands-on SQL evaluation project.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Relational database design
- Writing queries with filtering, grouping, and aggregation
- SQL functions for analysis
- Integrating SQL with Python (SQLite and Db2)

## 💻 SQL/Tableau Evaluation Project
Includes a mini-project demonstrating applied SQL skills, and a Tableau evaluation presentation of data.

## 📊 K–12 Literacy Evaluation Project
This project models how literacy data can be structured, analyzed, and visualized to support classroom decision‑making. It focuses on an imaginary teacher’s class and tracks student progress across Fall, Winter, and Spring assessments.

* **Schema Design**: `schema.sql` defines tables for students and literacy assessments, including grade level, reading level, seasonal scores, and identified strengths/weaknesses.  
* **Data Population**: `data.sql` provides realistic sample data for students in grades 3–4, with reading scores, grade‑level ranges, and literacy focus areas.  
* **Query Analysis**: `queries.sql` demonstrates how to calculate average growth, identify students below grade level, and compare literacy weaknesses between Fall and Spring.  
* **Visualization**: Tableau dashboards highlight student areas of weakness, track below‑level counts over time, and show average growth from Fall to Spring.  

Together, these files demonstrate the application of SQL and BI skills in a real-world K–12 context. They mirror the evaluation workflows used in educational AI quality analysis: designing experiments, identifying areas of improvement, and presenting insights in **educator‑friendly dashboards**.

## 📚 Study Notes

## Hi there 👋

# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (Coursera, IBM)

This repository documents my progress in the Coursera course **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**, offered by IBM.  

I am currently halfway through **Module 3**, focusing on intermediate skills such as `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`.

---

## 📚 Module 3 Topics
- **LIKE**: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE pattern;`
- **BETWEEN**: `SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;`
- **ORDER BY**: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;`
- **GROUP BY**: `SELECT column_name FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;`
- **HAVING**: `SELECT column_name FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING condition;`

---

## 📚 Module 2 Topics
Focused on creating and modifying database structures:
- **CREATE TABLE**: `CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 datatype, col2 datatype, ...);`
- **ALTER TABLE**: Add, modify, drop, or rename columns
- **TRUNCATE TABLE**: `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`
- **DROP TABLE**: `DROP TABLE table_name;`

---

## 📚 Module 1 Topics
Introduced basic SQL commands for querying and modifying data:
- **SELECT**: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;`
- **WHERE**: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
- **COUNT**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;`
- **DISTINCT**: `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;`
- **LIMIT**: `SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;`
- **INSERT**: `INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2) VALUES (val1, val2);`
- **UPDATE**: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value WHERE condition;`
- **DELETE**: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

---

## 📝 Example Query
```sql
-- Find average score by evaluator
SELECT evaluator_id,
       AVG(score) AS avg_score
FROM evaluations
GROUP BY evaluator_id
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Complete Module 3 (joins and advanced filtering)
- Begin Module 4: Integrating SQL with Python
- Add more practice queries to this repo

## 📚 Updated Learning: Thursday, November 13, 2025

I’ve successfully completed the Coursera/IBM course **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**, verified via [Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/0d7da86e-b756-4867-a726-b82771ea634f/public_url).

---

## Module 4: Accessing Databases with Python
Introduced Python integration with databases, focusing on SQLite and Db2 connections.

### SQLite
- connect(): sqlite3.connect()
- cursor(): con.cursor()
- execute(): cursor_obj.execute()
- fetchall(): cursor_obj.fetchall()
- fetchmany(): cursor_obj.fetchmany()
- read_sql_query(): read_sql_query()
- shape: dataframe.shape
- close(): con.close()
- CREATE TABLE: CREATE TABLE table_name (...)
- barplot(): seaborn.barplot(x="x-axis_variable", y="y-axis_variable", data=data)
- read_csv(): df = pd.read_csv('file_path.csv')
- to_sql(): df.to_sql('table_name', index=False)
- read_sql(): df = pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)

### Db2
- connect(): ibm_db.connect('DATABASE=...; HOST=...; PORT=...; UID=...; PWD=...')
- server_info(): ibm_db.server_info()
- close(): con.close()
- exec_immediate(): ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, sql_statement)

---

## Module 3: SQL Functions and Implicit Joins
Focused on functions and query operations to strengthen data analysis.

- COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX
- ROUND, LENGTH, UCASE, LCASE
- DISTINCT, DAY, CURRENT_DATE
- DATEDIFF(), FROM_DAYS(), DATE_ADD(), DATE_SUB()
- Subqueries
- Implicit Inner Join
- Implicit Cross Join

---

These skills build on my foundation in SQL and prepare me to apply database queries in real‑world QA and AI workflows.
